# MyPersonalConnectedHealth (MyPCH)
There are 425 million adult people (1 out of 11) diagnosed with Diabetes in the world today and it is a growing epidemic. The diabetes treatment is a very complex puzzle to get the right dose of medicine and many people do not have adequate resources to follow the prescribed dose regimes. This leads to serious healthcare issues and increased costs.

The good news is that technology like self-monitoring devices of blood glucose can help solve the dose puzzle by using a data-driven diabetes management approach. Sharing these new digital health data from self-monitoring devices with doctors, researchers and others is indispensable for success.

We believe that our innovation is a paradigm shift in sharing self-monitoring health data. The innovation will be open source, empower the individual by sharing data in a secure, trusted, auditable, traceable and consensus-based way inspired by MyData principles.
