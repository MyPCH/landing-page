# MyPersonalConnectedHealth (MyPCH)
There are 425 million adult people (1 out of 11) diagnosed with Diabetes in the world today and it is a growing epidemic. The diabetes treatment is a very complex puzzle to get the right dose of medicine and many people do not have adequate resources to follow the prescribed dose regimes. This leads to serious healthcare issues and increased costs.

The good news is that technology like self-monitoring devices of blood glucose can help solve the dose puzzle by using a data-driven diabetes management approach. Sharing these new digital health data from self-monitoring devices with doctors, researchers and others is indispensable for success.

We believe that our innovation is a paradigm shift in sharing self-monitoring health data. The innovation will be open source, empower the individual by sharing data in a secure, trusted, auditable, traceable and consensus-based way inspired by MyData principles.

In the NGI funded MyPCH project we developed several technologies for secure and traceable data exchange of diabetes data which are the key highlights of this project: 
[Digital Watermarking](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/digital-watermarking/), [Semantic Annotation](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/semantic-technologies-for-semantic-container/), and [Data Traceability](https://github.com/sem-con/sc-diabetes/tree/master/dataflows/Data_Tracing).In addition, we participated in a MyData Health initiative to write a feature article for the European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) and we are proud to announce that the article written by 14 individuals from 9 countries around the 6 MyData principles is already published and public available via the [EMWA journal website](https://journal.emwa.org/the-data-economy/mydata-applying-human-centric-principles-to-health-data/) – see section “Data Interoperability” and “Establishing trust between stakeholders for health data use” for example use cases of Semantic Containers. Furthermore another publication "Towards Informed Watermarking of Personal Health Sensor Data for Data Leakage Detection" Is In the proceedings of the [International Workshop on Digital Watermarking 2020](http://www.iwdw.site/) taking place in November this year.

Both, [Own Your Data](https://www.ownyourdata.eu/en/ownyourdata-is-mydata-operator-2020/) and [Diabetes Services](https://www.diabetes.services), have been selected as [MyData Operator 2020](https://mydata.org/operators/).
